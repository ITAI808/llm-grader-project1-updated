test1,1.65,"Bits answer (0.20): The student provided only the first two bytes of the binary string, missing the rest. This incomplete answer earns a small amount of credit for showing partial understanding. | Decimal answer (0.50): Exact match to the correct answer. Full credit awarded. | Hex answer (0.50): Correct answer, matches the expected hex string exactly. | Base64 answer (0.45): The answer decodes to the same phrase, but the padding and line‑break differ from the expected string. Close, but not exact."
test2,2,"Bits answer (0.50): Excellent! The binary string matches the correct answer exactly. Full credit awarded. | Decimal answer (0.50): Correct answer, full credit. | Hex answer (0.50): The answer matches the correct hex sequence exactly. Full credit awarded. | Base64 answer (0.50): Correct answer provided."
test3,1.95,"Bits answer (0.50): Excellent, the student’s answer matches the correct bit string exactly. 0.5 points. | Decimal answer (0.50): Correct! Full credit. | Hex answer (0.50): Correct, full credit awarded. | Base64 answer (0.45): The answer decodes to the same text with an added newline – a very small difference, so it deserves partial credit."
test4 ,1.95,"Bits answer (0.50): Excellent, the answer exactly matches the correct bit sequence. | Decimal answer (0.50): The answer exactly matches the correct solution. Full credit awarded. | Hex answer (0.50): Your answer exactly matches the correct hex string, so you receive full credit. | Base64 answer (0.45): Your answer is almost correct; you encoded the message properly but added an extra '0K' at the end instead of the proper '==' padding. Remove the trailing characters to match the expected result."
